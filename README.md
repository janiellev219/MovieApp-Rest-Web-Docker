# MovieApp-Rest-Web-Docker

For this Application you will have to run a MongoDb server in the background

The data folder will have to be created where the mongoDB server can be activated which will allow for you to see
where I database is stored

This Restful Web service had been a challenging project but educational as a lot of functions and time goes into how
to implement a database and a docker as well.

Please follow how to run an NPM instructions when starting this app. You will also notice within our code our image is from online.

Do take the time to look over all of the code as certain functions may not work if not named correctly. 

The presentation for this final project is also attached in this file so you may see some details on the JSON output of what information is stored in our database.

This was a class project and I had gotten assistance from this cite https://closebrace.com/tutorials/2017-03-02/creating-a-simple-restful-web-app-with-nodejs-express-and-mongodb.
